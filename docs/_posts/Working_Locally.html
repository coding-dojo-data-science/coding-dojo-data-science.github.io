<p><br></p><br><hr></hr><br><h1>2. GitHub Desktop</h1>
<p>Now that you have 2. GitHub Desktop and python installed locally, you should create a new GitHub repository and Jupyter
        Notebook for each assignment (except for your Project Assignments - each Project should have its own repo). This
        lesson will walk you through creating a new repository and notebook with annotated screenshots. <br></p>

                target="_blank">reference slides</a> for a summary of the workflow for creating and working in Jupyter
        notebooks and GitHub desktop. You will want to refer back to this regularly as you get used to working on your
        local computer. </p>

<blockquote>Scroll down for a visual comparison of the Colab vs Jupyter Notebook!<br></blockquote>
<h2>Tips for Moving from Google Colab to Jupyter Notebook</h2>
<p>Google Colab was designed to mimic Jupyter Notebooks. While they are different, they fundamentally work the same way.
	Here are a few tips for moving from Colab to Jupyter.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Auto-Complete and Docstrings are NOT automatic with Jupyter Notebooks.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Press "Tab" to get a suggested autocompletion.<ul>
					<li>This works for file paths, too!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Press "Shift+Tab" when your cursor is inside the parentheses for a function.<ul>
					<li>Press Shift+Tab 4 times in a row to open the documentation in a larger window.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Repos, repos, repos!</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>You will pretty much always want to create a new notebook or analysis inside a GitHub repository. This
				makes it easier to find the notebook again, share it, and keep essential files stored with your
				notebook.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Accessing Files will work very differently.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>You will no longer be mounting Google Drive to access your files.<ul>
					<li>Instead, you will download files to your computer (preferably in the same repo folder as your
						notebook).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>Interface Comparison</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the screenshots below, several key functions have been annotated using color to convey which elements of the
		Coalb interface is equivalent to what elements of the Jupyter Notebook interface. <ul>
			<li>Note: in some situations, the functionality of 1 element in Colab is split into 2 in Jupyter (or vice
				versa).</li>
			<li>For more information, please read the Guide: Your Local Workflow lesson and watch the included
				walkthrough.</li>
		</ul>

<h1>4. Resource: Terminal Commands</h1>
<p>To get started, open up your terminal or GitBash and try the commands below. Note that most of these work well in the
	Windows command prompt (cmd) as well, but not all of them. </p>
<p><br></p>
<blockquote><strong>For an interactive game to help learn terminal/gitbash commands</strong>, check out: <a
		href="http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html">http://web.mit.edu/mprat/Public/web/Terminus/Web/main.html</a>
</blockquote>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Windows users are strongly encouraged to use GitBash instead of the Command Prompt. </strong>The Command
	Prompt does not use the same commands. For a table comparison of commands for a Linux-based shell vs windows'
	command prompt, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/" target="_blank">see this
		article</a>.</p>
<p></p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Present working directory</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">pwd
</pre>
<p>Use this command any time you are unsure where you are currently in your file structure. <em>pwd</em> stands for
	Present Working Directory. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>List files</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="php" class="active_pre rainbow">ls
</pre>
<p>Use the <em>ls</em> command to see all the directories and files that are in your current directory. To clear things
	up, a directory is just a synonym for a folder.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>List files (long form)</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">ls -l
</pre>
<p>Use the '<em>ls -l'</em> command to see a long-form, representation of the directories and files inside your current
	directory.</p>
<p>You will see some cryptic messages on the side. The '<i>drwx</i>' thing that you see are just file permissions for
	that particular directory or file. For example, the first set of<em> '-'s</em> that follow the<i> 'd</i><em>'</em>
	are the permissions allowed for the user. If it says '<em>rwx'</em> it means the user is allowed to read, write and
	execute the file. If it just says <em>'r--' </em>means that the user can only read the file. The second set of three
	<em>'-'s</em> represent the permissions for a group. The last three <em>'-'s</em> represent the permissions for
	people who are not the user and are not in the particular group that is allowed. We will have to be changing some of
	these permissions when we deploy our applications in the cloud. For now, it's important to know that there are
	different file permissions which can either be read, write, or execute, and these permissions can vary depending on
	if you are the user, or in the group specified in the listing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>List all files (long form)</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">ls -a
</pre>
<p>Use the<em> 'ls - a'</em> command to see ALL the files. Linux flavored operating systems hide files that start with a
	'.' by default. This command will show all the previous files and hidden files if there are any. The files that
	start with a '.' are often configuration files.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing to the current directory</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cd .
</pre>
<p>From the previous command, we saw that<em> 'ls - a'</em> will list some interesting file names like '.' and '..' The
	'.' is reserved to represent the current directory that we are in. If you run the <em>'cd . '</em> and then run the
	'<em>pwd</em>' command, you'll see that we didn't move to a different directory. We told the computer to change our
	directory to our current directory which means don't go anywhere! </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing to the parent directory</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="php" class="rainbow">cd ..
</pre>
<p>Like the <em>'cd . ' </em>command, the '..' is reserved to represent the parent directory of the current folder that
	we are in. If you run this command and then run the '<em>pwd</em>' command, you'll see that we navigated up one
	directory(folder) structure. If you feel like the File Structure is starting to resemble the DOM (Document Object
	Model), it's because they are very similar.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing to the root directory</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cd /
</pre>
<p>This command will change to the root directory of your computer. From this folder, you can access your application
	folders.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing to any folder</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cd folder_name
</pre>
<p>The<em> 'cd' </em>command followed by a space and name of the folder you want to access will move you into that
	directory, if it exists. This example would move you into the 'folder_name' directory.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Making a new folder</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">mkdir new_directory_name
</pre>
<p>This command will make a new directory named 'new_directory_name'. Whatever argument you pass into this command will
	be the name of your new file. After making the directory, you could run 'cd new_folder_name' to enter into that
	directory.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Delete an empty directory(folder)</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">rm directory_name
//or
rmdir directory_name</pre>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Delete a non-empty directory(folder)</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">rm -rf directory_name
</pre>
<p>If you try to delete a folder with contents inside you will get an error! Our computer wants us to say more
	explicitly to delete this directory and everything inside of it by passing the<em> '-rf'</em> option. <strong>Be
		careful with this command </strong>as could it accidentally delete files you didn't intend to delete or delete
	some config files that you wouldn't want deleted at all!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Creating a new file</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">touch README.md
</pre>
<p>The <em>'touch'</em> command will create a new, empty file with the name and extension type that you specify. You can
	make any type of file if you provide the extension type. Run the above commands, and then run <em>'ls'</em> and you
	will see your new files in the listing.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Removing a file</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">rm README.md
</pre>
<p>The <em>'rm'</em> command removes any file with the filename and extension provided.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Renaming/Moving a file</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">mv README.md  new_filename.md
mv new_filename.md ../new_filename.md
</pre>
<p>The<em> 'mv' </em>command has two uses. First, you can rename a file by first providing the file's name and then
	providing what you want the file to be renamed to. In the first example, <em>index.html</em> would be renamed to
	<em>new_name_index.html</em>. Second, it can be used to move a file to a different folder. In the second example,
	<em>new_name_index.html </em>would be moved up one directory with the same name. In either case, think of this
	command as moving a file - into its current directory with a different name or into a different directory with the
	same or different name.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Copying a file</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cp README.md README_copy.md
</pre>
<p>The <em>'cp</em>' command will copy a file into the current directory with the new name you provided. In the example,
	say you were in your Desktop directory and you ran the above command. The Desktop directory would now have
	<em>index.html </em>and <em>copy.html in it.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Copying a directory</strong></em>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cp -rf directory_name copy_directory_name
</pre>
<p>Copying a directory is similar to a file but we need to pass the <em>'-rf'</em> option in order to copy all the
	internal contents of the directory. First provide the name of the directory you want to copy and then the name of
	the copy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Opening current directory in your GUI</strong></p>
<p><em>On Mac or Linux use the "open" command:</em></p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">open .
</pre>
<p>The <em>'open'</em> command will open your current directory in your GUI (in 'cmd' or command prompt, use "<em>start
		."</em> instead). Likewise, you could open a file inside your directory by running something like "open
	file_name". </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>On Windows, use the explorer command: </em></p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="python">explorer .
</pre>
<p>The <em>'open'</em> command will open your current directory in your GUI (in 'cmd' or command prompt, use "<em>start
		."</em> instead). Likewise, you could open a file inside your directory by running something like "open
	file_name". </p>

<p> <br></p>
<h3>Dealing with Files &gt;100 MB</h3>
<p>GitHub has a single-file-size limit of 100 MB. This means that attempting to commit any file larger than 100 MB will
	result in a fatal error when attempting to push your work to GitHub.</p>
<ul>
	<li>GitHub Desktop warns you if you are about to save a file that is over this limit using the pop-up below:</li>
</ul>
<figure><img
		src="../../images/lp/Large_file_warning.png"
		style="cursor: pointer; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></figure>
<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>NOTE: If you filter out all of the requested conditions for your movies, and saved them as gzip-compressed
			csv's, your files should NOT be over the 100 MB limit!</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>However, should you run into this following warning from GitHub desktop about your data files being too big you
		should follow the instructions below:<ul>
			<li>DO NOT CLICK COMMIT ANYWAY!!!</li>
			<li>Click <code>Cancel</code> instead. We are going to tell git to ignore those large files. This means that
				it will not try to save them to your commit, but it will let you keep them in the folder without
				complaining</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<figure><img
		src="../../images/lp/Large_file_warning.png"
		style="cursor: pointer; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></figure>
<ul>
	<li>For EACH file that was too large:<ul>
			<li>Right click on it from the sidebar of GitHub Desktop.</li>
			<li>Select <code>"Ignore file"</code></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<figure><img
		src="../../images/lp/ignore_file.png"
		style="cursor: pointer; max-width: 100%; height: auto;"></figure>
<ul>
	<li>You will see the large files' names disappear from the changes sidebar. Instead you will see that a file called
		<code>.gitignore</code> has appeared. This file is how github desktop knows which files to ignore.</li>

<p><br><br></p>
<h1>Package Manager: pip</h1>
<h2>Objectives:</h2>
<ul>
	<li>What is a package?</li>
	<li>What is a package manager?</li>
	<li>How to install new packages</li>
</ul>
<hr>
<p>Even though programming languages come with a lot right out of the box, you'll find yourself wanting to use some
	functionality that is not included in your language's standard library. For example, since Python can be used for
	more than just web development, web functionality does not come pre-loaded when we install Python. However, other
	developers have created <strong>packages</strong> that we can download so we don't have to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Pip is the <strong>package manager</strong> we'll use in Python to install these third-party packages. (There are
	other package managers, but for simplicity and fewer installations, we're sticking with pip because it was included
	when we installed Python.) Rather than having to go search for packages and versions ourselves, package managers are
	generally able to find the versions we need with just a single command from our end. </p>
<h2>Warning: installing new packages can break others!</h2>
<p>Python packages often rely on code found in other packages, then the other package is a "dependency". If the
	dependency package dramatically alters the code that the other package uses, updating the dependency package could
	break the other package!!!</p>
<p><strong>It is VERY possible that you will break your dojo-env at some point by installing new packages. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You should consider cloning your dojo-env </strong>as a new environment for you to test installing new
	packages. If you wanted to create a new clone called "new-env", you would enter the conda command below:</p>
<pre>conda create --name new-env --clone dojo-env
</pre>
<h2>
	<p>Then, you should switch to your cloned environment before installing the new package. </p>
	<pre>conda activate new-env</pre>
	<p><strong>For more information on managing your environment, see the <a
				href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html"
				target="_blank">Managing Environments page on Anaconda's website.</a></strong></p>To Install a New
	Package
</h2>
<p>Enter the pip install command in your terminal/GitBash. That command will look like this:</p>
<pre data-language="bash">pip install {{package}} &lt;= NOTE: substitute {{package}} with the package you are installing
</pre>
<p>For example, if you wanted to install pandas-profiling (<a href="https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/rtd/"
		target="_blank">documentation</a>), you would run the following (in your terminal/GitBash):</p>
<pre>pip install pandas-profiling</pre>
<p><strong>Important Note: ALWAYS CHECK THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANY NEW PACKAGE!! </strong></p>
<p>Usually, python packages have documentation either on a website like read the docs or as their README for the package
	repository. </p>
<p><strong>You should always check their instructions, i</strong>n case there are additional steps/considerations.</p>
<p>For example, if we check pandas-profiling <a
		href="https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/rtd/pages/installation.html" target="_blank">Installation
		instructions</a>, we would see that they have an additional command that we need to run:</p>
<pre>pip install -U pandas-profiling[notebook]
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
</pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Pip will then download the package requested and any packages that it may require. You will see progress bars and a
	message indicating if it was successful or not.</p>
<p>As an example, the output will look something like below if we were to install Django:</p>
<p>
	<img width="700"
		src="https://s3.amazonaws.com/General_V88/boomyeah2015/codingdojo/curriculum/content/chapter/Screen_Shot_2018-03-20_at_5.56.54_PM.png">
</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>If You Encounter a Permissions Error</h2>
<ul>
	<li>First, try adding the --user flag to the end of your command. For example,</li>
</ul>
<pre class="active_pre">pip install pandas-profiling --user
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If the user flag doesn't fix it:</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>For Windows users: </strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Try right-clicking on GitBash in the Start Menu and "Run as Administrator", then try again.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>For Mac Users:</strong></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Try going into System Preferences &gt; Security and Privacy &gt; click on the Privacy tab. </li>
			<li>Check the FIles and Folders section on the sidebar. </li>
			<li>If you do not see Terminal listen in the right sidebar (or if it is grayed out), click on the lock icon
				in the bottom left corner and then enter your usual password for your computer.</li>
			<li>Then click on the check box next to Terminal to grant access (or click the + button to add Terminal -
				which is stored in Applications &gt; Utilities)</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>
<p></p>
<h1>Package Manager: conda</h1>
<p>Just like we can install python packages from PyPi (using pip), we can also install packages from Anaconda. Check the
	Installation instructions on the documentation page for the package you want to install and see if they have both a
	conda and a pip installation option.</p>
<p>Generally, if there is a conda install command available, that will be the better option for your dojo-env. </p>
<p><strong>Note: if you ever break your environment, return to the the Instructions for Install Python Locally.
		Specifically, see the final lesson for "Updating your dojo-env"</strong></p>
<p><br></p><br><hr></hr><br><h1>8. Show Hidden Files</h1>
<p>Many files are used by our local installation that are "hidden files". </p>
<p>Hidden files are folders or files whose names start with a period. By default, these are not viewable in File
	Explorer/Finder. </p>
<p><strong>The are numerous situations where you may need to view your hidden files, see the OS-specific instructions
