<h1>GitBash Opens in the Wrong Folder</h1>
<h2></h2>
<h3>PROBLEM: </h3>
<div>Opening GitBash from Windows start menu (not from Github Desktop) and starting jupyter notebook displays a folder
	containing bin/cmd/dev/etc ( see screenshot below) instead of the expected User folder with Documents/Downloads/etc.
</div>

	<figure><img

			style="width: 660px; height: 548px;" width="660" height="548"></figure>
	<p></p>
	<h2>Cause</h2>
	<p>Your GitBash program defaults to the folder where GItBash is installed. What you are seeing above is the contents
		of C:/Program Files/GitBash. This happens to a small percentage of windows users. </p>
	<p><br></p>
	<h3>Solution/Workaround</h3>
</div>
<ul>
	<li>First, run the following echo command to add one more alias to GitBash and then open a new GitBash window</li>
</ul>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="ruby">echo 'alias ~="$HOME"' &gt;&gt; ~/.bash_profile</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Now test the command by runing the commands below to change directory to "~" and to display the current folder
		name. </li>
</ul>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="ruby">cd ~
ls</pre>
<ul>
	<li>If you can see your Downloads, Desktop, Documents, etc. folders then the alias worked!</li>
</ul>
<h3>New Workflow</h3>
<ul>
	<li>From now on, if you want to open a GitBash in your user folder, you will run "cd ~" as soon as you open a new
		GitBash window.<ul>
			<li>Note: if you are opening a specific repo from GitHub Desktop you will NOT want to run this command,
				since you are already in the desired folder.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
