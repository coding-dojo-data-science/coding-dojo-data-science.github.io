<h1>Uninstalling Anaconda (Completely)</h1>
<p>When facing stubborn environment problems, sometimes the best course of action is to completely uninstall the
	environment AND Anaconda and to start over. </p>
<p><strong>Pre-Uninstallation Verification Step:</strong></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you share your computer with another User who also uses Python:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Pause here and check with them BEFORE you uninstall anaconda. <strong>You will be removing all of their
					python environments too,</strong> even though they have a separate User account.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If you share your computer with someone and they have concerns about uninstalling anaconda: </strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Stop here (for now)</strong>.<ul>
					<li>Do not move forward with the instructions until you have spoken with your instructor. </li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h4>Official Steps for Fully Uninstalling Anaconda:</h4>
<p>The following steps are taken directly from the <a href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/"
		target="_blank">Official Uninstalling Anaconda documentation page</a>, specifically "Option B. Full uninstall
	using Anaconda-Clean and simple remove."</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Install the Anaconda-Clean package from Anaconda Prompt (terminal on Linux or macOS):</strong></li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">conda install anaconda-clean</pre>
<ul>
	<li>In the same window, run the following command:</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">anaconda-clean --yes</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Once the process has been completed, manually delete any "anaconda3" or "anaconda2" folders that still exist.
		<ul>
			<li>It may be located in one of several possible folders. Run the following "ls -a" commands until you see a
				folder called "anconda2" or "anaconda3". </li>
			<li><strong>Once you see an anaconda folder, take note of:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li><strong> Which command showed the folder.</strong>
						<ul>
							<li><strong> Specifically, what did the command say after "ls -a" </strong></li>
							<li>We will refer to this as your "base folder" in the final step.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li><strong>If the anaconda folder was "anconda2" or "anaconda3"</strong>
						<ul>
							<li>We will refer to this as your "anaconda folder" in the final step.</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li><strong>and j</strong>ump to the very last command at the bottom of the page, with those 2 pieces of
				information.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">ls -a ~/
ls -a ~/opt/
ls -a /opt/</pre>
<ul>
	<li>Run the final command to remove the anaconda folder once you've identified your "base folder" and "anaconda
		folder".<ul>
			<li>Replace {base_folder} with the actual folder name</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li>Replace {anaconda_folder} with the actual folder name.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">rm -rf {base_folder}{anaconda_folder}
</pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Once you've replaced the placeholder folder names with your actual folder names, the command should look something
	like this:</p>
<pre data-language="ruby" class="rainbow">rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3
# or 
rm -rf ~/anaconda2
# or 
rm -rf ~/opt/anaconda3</pre>
<h4></h4>
<h4>Final Verification Step:</h4>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Now, open a new terminal window and try running the "conda" command again. Your terminal should say that
			conda is not found.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>If it says conda is not found, you are now ready to jump back up to the "Step 3
					Commands"</strong> header above.</li>
		</ul>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>If your computer still displays a list of conda commands</strong>: please see the final portion
				of the <a
					href="https://docs.anaconda.com/anaconda/install/uninstall/#removing-anaconda-path-from-bash-profile"
					target="_blank">Official Uninstallation Instructions "Removing Anaconda from .bash_profile"</a>,
				which is illustrated below:</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Open the two settings file for your terminal and remove anything related to anaconda:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>1) Run the "open ~/.bash_profile" (without quotation marks) command and a text editor window
					should open.</strong>
				<ul>
					<li> Examine the contents of this file and <strong>delete any lines that look like either of the
							screenshots below</strong>:<ul>
							<li><br><img
									src="../../images/lp/conda_init_code.png">
							</li>
							<li><img
									src="../../images/lp/Screen_Shot_2022-08-05_at_6.55.05_PM.png">
							</li>
						</ul>
					</li>
					<li>Save the file and close it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>2) <strong>Now repeat the process, but use the "open ~/.zshrc"</strong> (without quotation marks)
				command<ul>
					<li>Delete any lines of code that look like the screenshots above.</li>
					<li>Save the file and close it.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>FInal Verification:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Open a New Terminal Window (the changes you made above only take effect when opening a new window)</li>
			<li>Run the "conda" command again and you should now see a message that says "conda not found"<ul>
					<li>If you are still seeing the list of conda commands instead, re-open the two files listed above
						and make sure you saved them after deleting the lines of code. </li>
					<li>Close your terminal window and open a new one and try the "conda" command again.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>
<p><br></p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If the conda command still displays the list of commands after the steps above:</strong>
		<ul>
			<li><strong>Try restarting your computer </strong>and attempting to run the command one more time.</li>
			<li><strong>If you are still seeing conda commands:</strong>
				<ul>
					<li>You should post your problem on the <a
