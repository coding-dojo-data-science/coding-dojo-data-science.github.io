<hr>
<p>Even though programming languages come with a lot right out of the box, you'll find yourself wanting to use some
	functionality that is not included in your language's standard library. For example, since Python can be used for
	more than just web development, web functionality does not come pre-loaded when we install Python. However, other
	developers have created <strong>packages</strong> that we can download so we don't have to reinvent the wheel.</p>
<p>Pip is the <strong>package manager</strong> we'll use in Python to install these third-party packages. (There are
	other package managers, but for simplicity and fewer installations, we're sticking with pip because it was included
	when we installed Python.) Rather than having to go search for packages and versions ourselves, package managers are
	generally able to find the versions we need with just a single command from our end. </p>
<h2>Warning: installing new packages can break others!</h2>
<p>Python packages often rely on code found in other packages, then the other package is a "dependency". If the
	dependency package dramatically alters the code that the other package uses, updating the dependency package could
	break the other package!!!</p>
<p><strong>It is VERY possible that you will break your dojo-env at some point by installing new packages. </strong></p>
<p><strong>You should consider cloning your dojo-env </strong>as a new environment for you to test installing new
	packages. If you wanted to create a new clone called "new-env", you would enter the conda command below:</p>
<pre>conda create --name new-env --clone dojo-env
</pre>
<h2>
	<p>Then, you should switch to your cloned environment before installing the new package. </p>
	<pre>conda activate new-env</pre>
	<p><strong>For more information on managing your environment, see the <a
				href="https://docs.conda.io/projects/conda/en/latest/user-guide/tasks/manage-environments.html"
				target="_blank">Managing Environments page on Anaconda's website.</a></strong></p>To Install a New
	Package
</h2>
<p>Enter the pip install command in your terminal/GitBash. That command will look like this:</p>
<pre data-language="bash">pip install {{package}} &lt;= NOTE: substitute {{package}} with the package you are installing
</pre>
<p>For example, if you wanted to install pandas-profiling (<a href="https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/rtd/"
		target="_blank">documentation</a>), you would run the following (in your terminal/GitBash):</p>
<pre>pip install pandas-profiling</pre>
<p><strong>Important Note: ALWAYS CHECK THE INSTALLATION INSTRUCTIONS FOR ANY NEW PACKAGE!! </strong></p>
<p>Usually, python packages have documentation either on a website like read the docs or as their README for the package
	repository. </p>
<p><strong>You should always check their instructions, i</strong>n case there are additional steps/considerations.</p>
<p>For example, if we check pandas-profiling <a
		href="https://pandas-profiling.ydata.ai/docs/master/rtd/pages/installation.html" target="_blank">Installation
		instructions</a>, we would see that they have an additional command that we need to run:</p>
<pre>pip install -U pandas-profiling[notebook]
jupyter nbextension enable --py widgetsnbextension
</pre>
<p><br></p>
<p>Pip will then download the package requested and any packages that it may require. You will see progress bars and a
	message indicating if it was successful or not.</p>
<p>As an example, the output will look something like below if we were to install Django:</p>

</p>
<p><br></p>
<h2>If You Encounter a Permissions Error</h2>
<ul>
	<li>First, try adding the --user flag to the end of your command. For example,</li>
</ul>
<pre class="active_pre">pip install pandas-profiling --user
</pre>
<ul>
	<li><strong>If the user flag doesn't fix it:</strong></li>
	<ul>
		<li><strong>For Windows users: </strong>
			<ul>
				<li>Try right-clicking on GitBash in the Start Menu and "Run as Administrator", then try again.</li>
			</ul>
		</li>
		<li><strong>For Mac Users:</strong></li>
		<ul>
			<li>Try going into System Preferences &gt; Security and Privacy &gt; click on the Privacy tab. </li>
			<li>Check the FIles and Folders section on the sidebar. </li>
			<li>If you do not see Terminal listen in the right sidebar (or if it is grayed out), click on the lock icon
				in the bottom left corner and then enter your usual password for your computer.</li>
			<li>Then click on the check box next to Terminal to grant access (or click the + button to add Terminal -
				which is stored in Applications &gt; Utilities)</li>
		</ul>
	</ul>
</ul>

<h1>Package Manager: conda</h1>
<p>Just like we can install python packages from PyPi (using pip), we can also install packages from Anaconda. Check the
	Installation instructions on the documentation page for the package you want to install and see if they have both a
	conda and a pip installation option.</p>
<p>Generally, if there is a conda install command available, that will be the better option for your dojo-env. </p>
<p><strong>Note: if you ever break your environment, return to the the Instructions for Install Python Locally.
		Specifically, see the final lesson for "Updating your dojo-env"</strong></p>
