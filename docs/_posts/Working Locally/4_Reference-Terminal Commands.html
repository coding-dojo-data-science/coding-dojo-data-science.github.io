<h1>Resource: Terminal Commands</h1>
<p>To get started, open up your terminal or GitBash and try the commands below. Note that most of these work well in the
	Windows command prompt (cmd) as well, but not all of them. </p>
<p><br></p>

<p><strong>Windows users are strongly encouraged to use GitBash instead of the Command Prompt. </strong>The Command
	Prompt does not use the same commands. For a table comparison of commands for a Linux-based shell vs windows'
	command prompt, <a href="https://www.geeksforgeeks.org/linux-vs-windows-commands/" target="_blank">see this
		article</a>.</p>

<p>
	<strong>Present working directory</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">pwd
</pre>
<p>Use this command any time you are unsure where you are currently in your file structure. <em>pwd</em> stands for
	Present Working Directory. </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>List files</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="php" class="active_pre rainbow">ls
</pre>
<p>Use the <em>ls</em> command to see all the directories and files that are in your current directory. To clear things
	up, a directory is just a synonym for a folder.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>List files (long form)</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">ls -l
</pre>
<p>Use the '<em>ls -l'</em> command to see a long-form, representation of the directories and files inside your current
	directory.</p>
<p>You will see some cryptic messages on the side. The '<i>drwx</i>' thing that you see are just file permissions for
	that particular directory or file. For example, the first set of<em> '-'s</em> that follow the<i> 'd</i><em>'</em>
	are the permissions allowed for the user. If it says '<em>rwx'</em> it means the user is allowed to read, write and
	execute the file. If it just says <em>'r--' </em>means that the user can only read the file. The second set of three
	<em>'-'s</em> represent the permissions for a group. The last three <em>'-'s</em> represent the permissions for
	people who are not the user and are not in the particular group that is allowed. We will have to be changing some of
	these permissions when we deploy our applications in the cloud. For now, it's important to know that there are
	different file permissions which can either be read, write, or execute, and these permissions can vary depending on
	if you are the user, or in the group specified in the listing.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>List all files (long form)</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">ls -a
</pre>
<p>Use the<em> 'ls - a'</em> command to see ALL the files. Linux flavored operating systems hide files that start with a
	'.' by default. This command will show all the previous files and hidden files if there are any. The files that
	start with a '.' are often configuration files.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing to the current directory</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cd .
</pre>
<p>From the previous command, we saw that<em> 'ls - a'</em> will list some interesting file names like '.' and '..' The
	'.' is reserved to represent the current directory that we are in. If you run the <em>'cd . '</em> and then run the
	'<em>pwd</em>' command, you'll see that we didn't move to a different directory. We told the computer to change our
	directory to our current directory which means don't go anywhere! </p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing to the parent directory</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="php" class="rainbow">cd ..
</pre>
<p>Like the <em>'cd . ' </em>command, the '..' is reserved to represent the parent directory of the current folder that
	we are in. If you run this command and then run the '<em>pwd</em>' command, you'll see that we navigated up one
	directory(folder) structure. If you feel like the File Structure is starting to resemble the DOM (Document Object
	Model), it's because they are very similar.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing to the root directory</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cd /
</pre>
<p>This command will change to the root directory of your computer. From this folder, you can access your application
	folders.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Changing to any folder</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cd folder_name
</pre>
<p>The<em> 'cd' </em>command followed by a space and name of the folder you want to access will move you into that
	directory, if it exists. This example would move you into the 'folder_name' directory.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Making a new folder</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">mkdir new_directory_name
</pre>
<p>This command will make a new directory named 'new_directory_name'. Whatever argument you pass into this command will
	be the name of your new file. After making the directory, you could run 'cd new_folder_name' to enter into that
	directory.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Delete an empty directory(folder)</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">rm directory_name
//or
rmdir directory_name</pre>
<p><strong><br></strong></p>
<p>
	<strong>Delete a non-empty directory(folder)</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">rm -rf directory_name
</pre>
<p>If you try to delete a folder with contents inside you will get an error! Our computer wants us to say more
	explicitly to delete this directory and everything inside of it by passing the<em> '-rf'</em> option. <strong>Be
		careful with this command </strong>as could it accidentally delete files you didn't intend to delete or delete
	some config files that you wouldn't want deleted at all!</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Creating a new file</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">touch README.md
</pre>
<p>The <em>'touch'</em> command will create a new, empty file with the name and extension type that you specify. You can
	make any type of file if you provide the extension type. Run the above commands, and then run <em>'ls'</em> and you
	will see your new files in the listing.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Removing a file</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">rm README.md
</pre>
<p>The <em>'rm'</em> command removes any file with the filename and extension provided.</p>
<p>
	<strong>Renaming/Moving a file</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">mv README.md  new_filename.md
mv new_filename.md ../new_filename.md
</pre>
<p>The<em> 'mv' </em>command has two uses. First, you can rename a file by first providing the file's name and then
	providing what you want the file to be renamed to. In the first example, <em>index.html</em> would be renamed to
	<em>new_name_index.html</em>. Second, it can be used to move a file to a different folder. In the second example,
	<em>new_name_index.html </em>would be moved up one directory with the same name. In either case, think of this
	command as moving a file - into its current directory with a different name or into a different directory with the
	same or different name.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p>
	<strong>Copying a file</strong>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cp README.md README_copy.md
</pre>
<p>The <em>'cp</em>' command will copy a file into the current directory with the new name you provided. In the example,
	say you were in your Desktop directory and you ran the above command. The Desktop directory would now have
	<em>index.html </em>and <em>copy.html in it.</em></p>
<p></p>
<p>
	<em><strong>Copying a directory</strong></em>
</p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">cp -rf directory_name copy_directory_name
</pre>
<p>Copying a directory is similar to a file but we need to pass the <em>'-rf'</em> option in order to copy all the
	internal contents of the directory. First provide the name of the directory you want to copy and then the name of
	the copy.</p>
<p><br></p>
<p><strong>Opening current directory in your GUI</strong></p>
<p><em>On Mac or Linux use the "open" command:</em></p>
<pre data-language="python" class="rainbow">open .
</pre>
<p>The <em>'open'</em> command will open your current directory in your GUI (in 'cmd' or command prompt, use "<em>start
		."</em> instead). Likewise, you could open a file inside your directory by running something like "open
	file_name". </p>
<p><br></p>
<p><em>On Windows, use the explorer command: </em></p>
<pre class="rainbow" data-language="python">explorer .
</pre>
<p>The <em>'open'</em> command will open your current directory in your GUI (in 'cmd' or command prompt, use "<em>start
		."</em> instead). Likewise, you could open a file inside your directory by running something like "open
	file_name". </p>
