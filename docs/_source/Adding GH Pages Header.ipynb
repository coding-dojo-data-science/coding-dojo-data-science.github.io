This will ensure that you have the tools you will need to be successful.\\n- We recommend you begin the step-by-step installation AS SOON AS POSSIBLE to ensure you have time to troubleshoot any difficulties you may encounter.\\n- These steps should take ~30-90 minutes, depending on the speed of your machine and internet connection.\\n\\n- If you run into issues during installation, see the \"How to Ask for Help\" secton at the bottom of this page. \\n\\n- The [dojo-env-setup repository](https://github.com/coding-dojo-data-science/dojo-env-setup), which you will clone in  Step 2.1, contains a backup copy of the entire set of instructions on the README, for convenience.\\n\\n***Note: if you previously installed the dojo-env and are upgrading to the current version, please see the \"Updating to New dojo-env\" instructions***\\n\\n<hr>\\n\\n## Installation Overview:\\n\\n<img src=\"images/1693253644__PythonInstallationforDSOverviewv234.png\">\\n\\nBy the end of this installation, you will:\\n\\n**1) Install or Set Up a Terminal application:**\\n\\n- The terminal is the primary application you will use to execute programming commands.\\n    - Mac and Linux users should already have a Terminal application installed.\\n    - Windows users will install additional software (Windows Terminal + Git for Windows)\\n\\n**2) Install a Python distribution:**\\n\\nThe foundation/infrastructure for installing our custom Python environment.\\n- Windows and Intel-Macs will install Anaconda. \\n- Apple Chip Macs will installing a lightweight alternative called miniforge. \\n\\n**3) Install GitHub Desktop**\\n\\n- Desktop application for working with and managing git repositories. \\n\\n**4) Create our custom Python environment (dojo-env)**\\n\\n- An environment is a bundle of specific versions of python packages that are mutually compatible.\\n- We will install our custom `dojo-env`` Python environment, located in the [dojo-env-setup repository](https://github.com/coding-dojo-data-science/dojo-env-setup).  \\n\\n**5) Test & customize the environment using Jupyter Notebook**\\n\\n- Jupyter Notebook will replace Google Colab on your local computer.\\n\\n**6) Install Visual Studio Code** as a secondary code editor.\\n\\n- A special text editor designed for code.
