<h1>Dealing with Large Files</h1>
<p> <br></p>
<h3>Dealing with Files &gt;100 MB</h3>
<p>GitHub has a single-file-size limit of 100 MB. This means that attempting to commit any file larger than 100 MB will
	result in a fatal error when attempting to push your work to GitHub.</p>
<ul>
	<li>GitHub Desktop warns you if you are about to save a file that is over this limit using the pop-up below:</li>
</ul>

<blockquote>
	<ul>
		<li>NOTE: If you filter out all of the requested conditions for your movies, and saved them as gzip-compressed
			csv's, your files should NOT be over the 100 MB limit!</li>
	</ul>
</blockquote>
<ul>
	<li>However, should you run into this following warning from GitHub desktop about your data files being too big you
		should follow the instructions below:<ul>
			<li>DO NOT CLICK COMMIT ANYWAY!!!</li>
			<li>Click <code>Cancel</code> instead. We are going to tell git to ignore those large files. This means that
				it will not try to save them to your commit, but it will let you keep them in the folder without
				complaining</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>For EACH file that was too large:<ul>
			<li>Right click on it from the sidebar of GitHub Desktop.</li>
			<li>Select <code>"Ignore file"</code></li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<ul>
	<li>You will see the large files' names disappear from the changes sidebar. Instead you will see that a file called
		<code>.gitignore</code> has appeared. This file is how github desktop knows which files to ignore.</li>
</ul>
