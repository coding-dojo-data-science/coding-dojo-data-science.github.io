<h2>Tips for Moving from Google Colab to Jupyter Notebook</h2>
<p>Google Colab was designed to mimic Jupyter Notebooks. While they are different, they fundamentally work the same way.
	Here are a few tips for moving from Colab to Jupyter.</p>
<ul>
	<li><strong>Auto-Complete and Docstrings are NOT automatic with Jupyter Notebooks.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>Press "Tab" to get a suggested autocompletion.<ul>
					<li>This works for file paths, too!</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
			<li>Press "Shift+Tab" when your cursor is inside the parentheses for a function.<ul>
					<li>Press Shift+Tab 4 times in a row to open the documentation in a larger window.</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Repos, repos, repos!</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>You will pretty much always want to create a new notebook or analysis inside a GitHub repository. This
				makes it easier to find the notebook again, share it, and keep essential files stored with your
				notebook.</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
	<li><strong>Accessing Files will work very differently.</strong>
		<ul>
			<li>You will no longer be mounting Google Drive to access your files.<ul>
					<li>Instead, you will download files to your computer (preferably in the same repo folder as your
						notebook).</li>
				</ul>
			</li>
		</ul>
	</li>
</ul>

<h2>Interface Comparison</h2>
<ul>
	<li>In the screenshots below, several key functions have been annotated using color to convey which elements of the
		Coalb interface is equivalent to what elements of the Jupyter Notebook interface. <ul>
			<li>Note: in some situations, the functionality of 1 element in Colab is split into 2 in Jupyter (or vice
				versa).</li>
			<li>For more information, please read the Guide: Your Local Workflow lesson and watch the included
				walkthrough.</li>
